3D Free Kick Simulator

A 3D Free Kick simulator built with C++ and the Raylib library. This project uses dynamic memory management and vector math to simulate realistic ball trajectories and spin.

This project was developed as an independent project to demonstrate skills in C++ and real-time physics simulation.
Features

    Realistic Physics: Simulates hundreds of trajectories per second, incorporating gravity, air resistance (drag), and the Magnus effect for accurate ball spin.

    Interactive Controls: Allows the user to adjust kick strength, angle, and spin in real-time.

    Responsive Visuals: Integrated with Raylib to provide smooth visual feedback at 60+ FPS.

    Collision Dynamics: Includes basic collision detection for the ground (with bounce physics) and the goal.

How to Compile and Run

This project is based on a Visual Studio Code template for Raylib.

    Ensure you have followed the setup instructions for the Raylib VS Code template (i.e., Raylib is located at C:/raylib/).

    Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.

    Open the main.cpp file.

    Press F5 to compile and run the project.

Controls

    Power: UP / DOWN arrow keys

    Angle: W / S keys

    Spin: LEFT / RIGHT arrow keys

    Kick: SPACEBAR

    Reset: ENTER
